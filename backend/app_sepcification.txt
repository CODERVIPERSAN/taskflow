Your app idea is a **self-balancing task manager** with a unique **numerical feedback system**. Here's a structured summary of your concept:

---

### ðŸ§  **App Concept: Self-Balancing Task Manager**

#### ðŸ”§ **Core Logic:**

* Each task or category (e.g., physical, learning, design) starts with a numerical value.
* Each **day**, tasks **increment by a fixed value** (e.g., +3 for all, +5 for physical).
* When a task is **completed**, its value **decreases by 1**.
* The **goal** is to **bring the total score to 0 or below**, indicating a balanced or surplus performance.
* This also accounts for:

  * Overachieving (more tasks done than required â†’ total < 0)
  * Underachieving (incomplete tasks accumulate â†’ total > 0)

---

### ðŸ“Š **Example Task Categories:**

From your screenshot:

* **4** â€“ design pattern, ievalo, backend
* **11** â€“ gfg, tuf, IITM, campus x
* **-4** â€“ GitHub recap, BDM schedule
* **-13** â€“ Duolingo, GRE prep, IELTS
* **29** â€“ pushups, pullups, sleep

### ðŸ“ˆ **Features to Include:**

1. **Daily Auto-Increment** (e.g., +3 general, +5 physical)
2. **Manual Task Completion** button (-1 per task)
3. **Neutrality Tracker** â€“ live sum showing whether user is in surplus, balanced, or deficit
4. **Trend Graph** â€“ visualize your progress toward 0 or negative territory
5. **Alerts/Notifications** â€“ remind based on high scores or streak breaks
6. **Task Log** â€“ track what was done and when
7. **Weighting System** â€“ optionally allow different tasks to have different weights (+/-)

---

### ðŸ§  **Why This Is Unique:**

* Rather than focusing only on checking off tasks, itâ€™s **system-driven** and **self-correcting**.
* Encourages **consistent effort** while allowing flexibility.
* Motivates through a **game-like score** system and **visual neutrality goal**.
